**Music Preference Analysis**

**Introduction**

Effective business decision-making relies on accurately formulated and tested hypotheses. This project aims to analyze music preferences among listeners in two cities, Springfield and Shelbyville, using real data from Y.Music. Our goal is to test hypotheses related to user behavior and music preferences to derive actionable insights.

**Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Determine if user activity varies by day and city.
2. Compare genres listened to by residents of Springfield and Shelbyville on Monday mornings and Friday nights.
3. Identify differences in music preferences between the two cities, specifically whether Springfield residents prefer pop music and Shelbyville residents favor rap music.

**Data Description**

The dataset includes the following columns:

1. userID: Unique identifier for each user.
2. Track: Title of the track.
3. artist: Name of the artist.
4. genre: Genre of the music.
5. City: City where the user is located.
6. time: Timestamp when the track was played.
7. Day: Day of the week when the track was played.

**Hypotheses**

We will test the following hypotheses:

1. User activity varies by day and city.
2. Residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres on Monday mornings and Friday nights.
3. There are distinct music preferences between Springfield (pop music) and Shelbyville (rap music).

**Methodology**

To achieve our objectives, we will follow these steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensure the dataset is clean and free of inconsistencies.
2. Descriptive Analysis: Provide an overview of the dataset, including user distribution across cities, popular genres, and overall listening habits.
3. Hypothesis Testing:

  - Analyze user activity patterns across different days and cities.
  - Compare genre preferences on Monday mornings and Friday nights between Springfield and Shelbyville.
  - Evaluate overall genre preferences in both cities.

4. Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

**Expected Outcomes**

Upon completion of this project, we expect to:

1. Understand how user activity varies by day and city.
2. Determine if there are significant genre preferences on specific days and times between Springfield and Shelbyville.
3. Identify overall music preferences in each city and any differences that exist.
4. This analysis will facilitate data-driven decisions for targeted marketing, content creation, and user engagement strategies tailored to the music preferences of each city.
